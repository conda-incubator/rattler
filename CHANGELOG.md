## [0.6.0] - 2023-07-07

### Highlights

#### New rust based solver implementation

This version of rattler includes a new solver implementation! 
@aochagavia worked hard on porting libsolv to rust and integrating that with `rattler_solve`.
The port performs slightly faster or similar to the original C code and does not contain unsafe code, is well documented, and thread-safe.
Our implementation (`rattler_libsolv_rs`) is specific to solving conda packages by leveraging `rattler_conda_types` for matching and parsing.

Some performance benchmarks taken on Apple M2 Max.

|                                    | libsolv-c    | libsolv-rs    |
| ---------------------------------- |--------------|---------------|
| python=3.9                         | 7.3734 ms    | **4.5831 ms** |
| xtensor, xsimd                     | 5.7521 ms    | **2.7643 ms** |
| tensorflow                         | 654.38 ms    | **371.59 ms** |
| quetz                              | **1.2577 s** | 1.3807 s      |
| tensorboard=2.1.1, grpc-cpp=1.39.1 | 474.76 ms    | **132.79 ms** |

> Run `cargo bench libsolv` to check the results on your own machine.

Besides the much improved implementation the new solver also provides much better error messages based on the work from mamba.
When a conflict is detected the incompatibilities are analyzed and displayed with a more user-friendly error message.

```
The following packages are incompatible
|-- asdf can be installed with any of the following options:
    |-- asdf 1.2.3 would require
        |-- C >1, which can be installed with any of the following options:
            |-- C 2.0.0
|-- C 1.0.0 is locked, but another version is required as reported above
```

`rattler-solve` has also been refactored to accommodate this change.
It is now more easily possible to switch between solvers add runtime by writing functions that are generic on the solver.
The solvers now live in a separate module `rattler_solve::libsolv_c` for the original libsolv C implementation and `rattler_solve::libsolv_rs` for the rust version.
Both solvers can be enabled with feature flags. The default features only select `libsolv_c`.

### Caching of activation scripts

This release contains code to execute an activation script and capture the changes it made to the environment.
Caching the result of an activation script can be useful if you need to invoke multiple executables from the same environment.

## [0.5.0] - 2023-06-30

### Highlights

A bug fix release

### Details

#### Added

- More control over how the PATH is altered during activation ([#232](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/pull/232))

#### Fixed

- Reconstructing of RepoData from conda lock files for local channels ([#231](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/pull/231))

## [0.4.0] - 2023-06-23

### Highlights

A new algorithm was introduced to sort `PackageRecord`s in a topological order based on their dependencies.
Sorting in this way provides a deterministic way of sorting packages in the order in which they should be installed to avoid clobbering.
The original algorithm was extracted from [rattler-server](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler-server).

Experimental extensions to the conda lock file format have also been introduced to make it possible to completely reproduce the original `RepoDataRecord`s from a lock file.

Fixes were made to the `MatchSpec` and `Version` implementation to catch some corner cases and detecting the current shell has become more robust.

### Details

#### Added

- `PackageRecord::sort_topologically` to perform a topological sort of `PackageRecord`s ([#218](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/pull/218))
- Experimental fields to be able to reconstruct `RepoDataRecord` from conda lock files. ([#221](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/pull/221))
- Methods to manipulate `Version`s ([#229](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/pull/229))

#### Changed

- Refactored shell detection code using `$SHELL` or parent process name ([#219](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/pull/219))
- The error message that is thrown when parsing a `Platform` now includes possible options ([#222](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/pull/222))
- Completely refactored `Version` implementation to reduce memory footprint and increase readability ([#227](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/pull/227))

#### Fixed

- Issue with parsing matchspecs that contain epochs ([#220](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/pull/220))
- Zsh activation scripts invoke .sh scripts ([#223](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/pull/223))
- Detect the proper powershell parent process ([#224](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/pull/224))

## [0.3.0] - 2023-06-15

### Highlights

This release contains lots of fixes, small (breaking) changes, and new features.
The biggest highlights are:

#### JLAP support

JLAP is a file format to incrementally update a cached `repodata.json` without downloading the entire file.
This can save a huge amount of bandwidth for large repodatas that change often (like those from conda-forge).
If you have a previously cached `repodata.json` on your system only small JSON patches are downloaded to bring your cache up to date.
The format was initially proposed through a [CEP](https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/pull/20) and has been available in conda as an experimental feature since `23.3.0`.

When using rattler you get JLAP support out of the box.
No changes are needed.

#### Support for local `file://`

`file://` based urls are now supported for all functions that use a Url to download certain data.

#### `rattler_networking`

A new crate has been added to facilitate authentication when downloading repodata or packages called `rattler_networking`.
