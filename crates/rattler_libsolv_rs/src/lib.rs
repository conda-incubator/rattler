//! Implements a SAT solver for dependency resolution based on the CDCL algorithm (conflict-driven
//! clause learning)
//!
//! The CDCL algorithm is masterly explained in [An Extensible
//! SAT-solver](http://minisat.se/downloads/MiniSat.pdf). Regarding the data structures used, we
//! mostly follow the approach taken by [libsolv](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv). The code of
//! libsolv is, however, very low level C, so if you are looking for an introduction to CDCL, you
//! are encouraged to look at the paper instead or to keep reading through this codebase and its
//! comments.
